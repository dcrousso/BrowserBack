# ![BrowserBack](https://github.com/dcrousso/BrowserBack/raw/master/Icons/icon-small.png) BrowserBack 

Are you one of the many people who loved using the ⌫ and ⌦ keys to navigate?  Do you miss having the feature in your browser?

Well miss no more!  BrowserBack is a simple and lightweight extension that brings back this functionality.  Simply install the extension and use ⌫ and ⌦ just like you used to.

As an added bonus, when using it you wont see the annoying "Press ⌘ and ← to go back" when using BrowserBack :)

If you are a frequent user of Incognito mode, you can always enable this extension in Incognito mode and enjoy the full functionality there as well.
